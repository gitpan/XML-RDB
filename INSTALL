  DSN:
  Look in the test directory ./t
  the test will be running all DSN configs from there.
  If you have SQLite, the default should work.
  SQLite, Pg, and mysql DBD drivers with a functional
  'test' database. So all test will fail without
  DBD drivers installed and functioning. 
 
  MOD DEPENDS:
  DBI, DBD (Postgresql, SQLite, or MySQL), DBIx, XML::DOM, URI::Escape
  vars, strict, LWP

The same drill:

  perl -e Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
 
done...

Forgive me for leaving some stuff out, or send an email with suggestions. 
CPAN is awesome and am confortably spoiled.
