Install:
--------

  DSN:
  Look in the test directory ./t
  the test will be running a DSN config from there.
  If you have SQLite, the default should work.
  Otherwise, put a working DSN pointing to the 
  'test' datablase.

  MOD DEPENDS:
  DBI, DBD (Postgresql, SQLite, or MySQL), DBIx, XML::DOM, URI::Escape
  vars, strict, LWP

The same drill:

  perl -e Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
 
done...

Forgive me for leaving some stuff out, or send an email with suggestions. 
CPAN is awesome and am confortably spoiled.

Q:  What is this?
  Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) at /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/DBIx/DBSchema/Table.pm line 381.
A: DBIx trying to create an index, when none is specified. Doen't do this under general usage, I'm not worried about it.

xml_rdb, the script that interfaces the perl modules XML::RDB. It's creation lead to many modifications to
XML::RDB.
