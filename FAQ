Q: Why doent it recognise the relation in the data?
A: The data isn't analysed, only the XML structures.

Q: Why doesn't the generated select statements bring back data?
A: The DDL is analysed to produce the select statements,
   the data may have mutually inclusive joins, or there isn't data
   in the fields. Additionally, the table may be called twice in
   the same statement.

Q: Why does it take so long to create the database?
A: XML::RDB is based on XML::DOM::Parser loading the XML tree structure
   from file into memory before any other work is commenced. There are
   a couple of passes through the tree which analyse and build the 
   DDL.  Loads the DDL, then extracts and loads the XML data an 
   element at a time.
