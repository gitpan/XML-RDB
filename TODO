TODO:

XSD is mentioned in the XML::RDB perldoc. Spent some time on it, however
not sure to fix it or convert this mod to DOM 2 standard libXML etc. Anyway
RDB/UnpopulateSchema.pm holds that code.

API needs re-tooling, some generic beautification has been done.
Need to address specific routines now.

Perldoc needs re-writing. !

The parsing routines are largely recursive, and could be further optimized.
Calls to DBIx should be targeted for replacement to bulk calls where applicable.

Would like this to generate XSL as well.

Generate DDL best guess column definitions.

Combine work tables, add summary information for extraction.
