TODO:

XSD is mentioned in the XML::RDB perldoc. Spent some time on it, however
not sure to fix it or convert this mod to DOM 2 standard libXML etc. Anyway
RDB/UnpopulateSchema.pm holds that code.

API needs re-tooling.

Perldoc needs re-writing.

The parsing routines are largely recursive, and could be optimized.

Would like this to generate XSL as well.

Generate DDL best guess column definitions.
